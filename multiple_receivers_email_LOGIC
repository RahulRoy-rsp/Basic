Things to make sure before running simple_email.py file
(1) You have successfully installed email validation package
  pip install py3-validate-email
(2) You have entered your email address and password properly in confidential_data.py file
(3) Also,both of these files(confidential_data.py and multiple_receivers_email.py) should be in same directory.
(4) Turn Allow less secure apps to ON. Be aware that this makes it easier for others to gain access to your account.
    Under “Security” catalogue, find “Less secure app access” and turn it on.
(5) Always try to use a development(create a dummy account) email address for this kind of stuff, an email id which is not much useful for you.
    Try not to use your personal(important) email id.

Usage :
Sending a simple email without any subject and attachments with multiple receipents.It could be useful in big organizations.

Working:
(1) We create a list which will contain the list of email addresses.
(2) Then, user is asked to enter the message that they want to send to the recipents.
(3) If the entered email address is verified successfully, then program asks the usere if they want to add more email addresses
  (4) If yes,then step (3) is repeated but this time it will check if the entered email address is already existing in the list or not.
  (5) If not, then the email is being sent to that receipent.

Upgradation can de done:
(1) This program can be upgraded such that a companies manager can send email to their employees automatically using an excel sheet and extracting employees email id from that sheet.
(2) This way they dont have to manually enter a larger number of employees email address.
