Things to make sure before running simple_email.py file
(1) You have successfully installed email validation package
  pip install py3-validate-email
(2) You have entered your email address and password properly in confidential_data.py file
(3) Also,both of these files(confidential_data.py and simple_email.py) should be in same directory
(4) Turn Allow less secure apps to ON. Be aware that this makes it easier for others to gain access to your account.
    Under “Security” catalogue, find “Less secure app access” and turn it on.
(5) Always try to use a development(create a dummy account) email address for this kind of stuff, an email id which is not much useful for you.
    Try not to use your personal(important) email id.

Usage :
(1) Sending a simple email without any subject and attachments

Working:

(2)If that email address is verified successfully then we ask the user to confirm that they want to send email to that email address
  (3)If user confirms,then SMTP session is started and user is asked to enter the message that they want to send.
  (4)If user does not confirms,then user has to enter the email address to whom they want to send email address.
